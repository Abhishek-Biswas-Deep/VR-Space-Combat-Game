## VR Space Combat Game
This repository contains the source code for an immersive VR space combat game developed using Babylon.js and WebXR. This project was a successful collaboration between my colleague and me.

#### Description
This game puts players in the midst of a space battle, allowing them to navigate and interact with various spacecraft in a 3D environment. The game features realistic physics, custom 3D models, and intuitive VR controls.

#### Features
Immersive VR experience using WebXR
Custom 3D models for spaceships and controllers
Physics-based movement system
Intuitive controls for navigation and interaction
Dynamic lighting and skybox for atmospheric space environment
Delta-V based movement system for realistic space navigation

#### Technologies Used
```
Babylon.js
WebXR
TypeScript
HTML5/CSS3
```
#### Setup and Installation:
**Clone the repository:**
git clone https://github.com/your-username/vr-space-combat-game.git

**Navigate to the project directory:**
cd vr-space-combat-game

**Install dependencies (assuming you're using npm):**
npm install

**Start the development server:**
npm start

#### Usage:
**To play the game:**
Ensure you have a VR-capable browser and VR headset.
Launch the game in your VR-capable browser.
Use the VR controllers to navigate and interact with the game environment.
The left controller displays your remaining Delta-V.
Use the thumbstick for horizontal movement, A/X buttons for vertical movement, and the squeeze button for precise maneuvering.
Enjoy!!
